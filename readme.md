# 🎬 IMDB Movie Data Analysis Project

This project performs exploratory data analysis on two datasets: `movies.csv` and `directors.csv`. The goal is to extract valuable insights about directors, movie budgets, revenues, popularity, and more.

## 📁 Dataset Used
- `movies.csv`: Contains metadata about movies like title, year, revenue, budget, popularity, etc.
- `directors.csv`: Contains details about directors including their ID and name.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

## 🔍 Key Tasks Performed
- Merged movie and director datasets on director ID.
- Cleaned and preprocessed data (handled nulls, redundant columns, and scaling).
- Analyzed:
  - Top directors by number of movies and total revenue
  - Revenue and budget trends
  - ROI (Return on Investment) calculation
  - Popularity and vote statistics
  - Correlations (e.g., between budget and revenue)
  - High-budget flops and low-budget hits
